# Hello, My Name is Evan Drake.

This repo will be here as the semester goes on. I will post any code examples that I make in sessions in this repo where you may look at them or clone the repo and play with them.

I use git, github, Latex, and markdown often so if there are any questions on how to use it please dont hesitate to ask. if you want to learn more about git there is a free book on the langauge called 'git pro'.

tiny git tutorial for those who have not used it. git is a version control system that allows many different programers to work together. git allows you to save and store your work at multiple instances and can be easily uploaded and downloaded from online repositories. invented by the same guy that started the linux project.

to download a repo say my repo from the internet you would CLONE it. do not FORK it and do not make a PULL request. these are the steps to do so.

1. install git, if you are on windows you have to go to https://git-scm.com/downloads. if you are on mac you can use brew or use the windows method. if you are on linux use your package manager. for unbuntu it would be:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
2. open a terminal on your computer(powershell on windows) and go to the directory of your choice.
```bash
$ cd ~/Documents/<my-git-repo>
```
3.now clone the repo using either SSH or HTTPS. example of HTTPS:
```git
git clone git@github.com:snowmang1/Book_of_Spells.git
```
following these steps will clone the current state of my repo.
